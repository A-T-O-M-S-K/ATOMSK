All lefts, rights, ups and downs reversed.

This code may be modified and/or redistributed, as long as the conditions of
the UnSX License for Software v2 are met:

1.  Redistributed packages must retain this LICENSE file and any
    documentation that was included in the original. This is also true for
    precompiled binary distributions.
2.  In the event of a redistribution of code or a binary package, the
    redistributor(s) must communicate the original sources of their work, and
    notify the original author(s), too. It's nice to stay in touch.
3.  The code can be closed and relicensed to form part of a proprietary
    software package, as long as the author(s) give their explicit permission
    and are credited in the final product.
4.  The author(s) or redistributor(s) can charge money for precompiled
    binary packages, but not source code. The code must always stay free
    ("free" as in "free candy", without any pedophilia involved).
    Aditionally, there must be no requirement of previous registration,
    donation or any kind of action from an individual interested in obtaining
    the source code. It must always be directly accessible and downloadable.
    The only exception for this are proprietary distributions, as long as the
    other conditions are met.
5.  You shall not use this software for any illegal activity, including, but
    not limited to, manufacturing explosives, biological or nuclear weapons,
    summoning creatures of evil and/or causing the end of the world, stealing
    candy from little kids or throwing eggs at houses.
6.  The coding method of the author(s) shall always be respected, including
    their indentation style, variable naming, the inclusion or not of
    comments or even the editor used for writing their code (emacs, vi, nano,
    direct echoing to the compiler, etc.).
7.  All your base are belong to us.
8.  You may share this software over P2P networks, give out CDs to friends,
    family, etc. As long as there is no profit to it. Piracy is fine when the
    distributor is not earning money with the work of others.
9.  The original author(s) and anyone involved in modifying and/or
    redistributing code under the UnSX license v2 must accept that Cirno is
    the strongest in all of Gensokyo.
A.  By using the UnSX License for Software, I hereby acknowledge Beatrice
    the Golden as a witch and accept her existence.
B.  You shall not violate this license. You may, though, invite her to a
    lovely dinner for two, then confess your love for her and have crazy sex
    for the rest of the night. Consensual, of course. Rape is very bad.

THIS SOFTWARE COMES WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND AS SUCH IT IS NOT EVEN
GUARANTEED TO WORK PROPERLY OR DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO. IT MIGHT EVEN TRY
TO GO ROGUE AND KILL YOUR FAMILY WHILE YOU SLEEP. THE AUTHOR(S) WILL NOT BE
HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED TO OR BY THE PRODUCT, ESPECIALLY IF
THE USER IS ABSOLUTELY INCOMPETENT AND BREAKS EVERYTHING.

Please do not take most of this license seriously. It's meant to be a joke.
